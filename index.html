        <div class="subheading mb-5">Biochemistry</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">From my early days as a biochemistry undergraduate at the University of California, Riverside (UCR), I felt an innate pull towards understanding the intricate balance between scientific discovery and its practical implementation. While most of my peers were engrossed in laboratory experiments and deciphering molecular structures, I was intrigued by the question: "How do these discoveries make their way to the real world, benefitting society at large?" This curiosity led me to the world of regulatory affairs.<br><br>
          
          As a 4th year biochemistry major, I have had the opportunity to intern at Microvention for the regulatory affairs department. In doing so, I have gained familiarity in MDD and MDR submissions. I have also learned the process in the life cycle of a medical device. Here, I was exposed to the meticulous processes behind regulatory submissions, product labeling, and post-market surveillance. I quickly understood that regulatory affairs wasn’t just about compliance; it was the linchpin ensuring that scientific products were safe and effective for the end-users.<br><br>

        Other than the internship, I have also conducted research at UCR under Dr. Carson performing tests on microglia. In doing so, I have gained hands on experience in different procedures concerning molecular biology and chemistry. I undertook a research project analyzing the global regulatory differences in gene therapy products. This endeavor was a synthesis of my biochemistry knowledge and regulatory expertise. By comparing frameworks across different nations, I aimed to identify best practices and areas of harmonization, providing insights that could streamline gene therapy development and approval processes.<br><br>

        In addition to these experiences, I spent time working at Beachside Optometry where I conducted preliminary examinations on patients. I took their patient history and answered any underlying questions they had before sending them to the doctors. It helped me really understand what demographic I was catering to in my advancement of regulatory affairs.<br><br>
        
        Building on this foundation, I sought out opportunities to deepen my knowledge. In my junior year, I collaborated with the Regulatory Affairs Student Society, where I spearheaded community outreach programs. We organized workshops that educated students and local biotech startups about the regulatory landscape, demystifying the complex web of rules and guidelines. These sessions, often filled with lively debates and discussions, further fueled my passion for the field.<br><br>

The summer before my senior year was a pivotal period in my regulatory journey. Securing a position with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), I was part of a team overseeing the approval process for new drugs. The stakes were high, and every decision made reverberated through the healthcare ecosystem. Here, I honed my skills in risk assessment, understanding the nuanced balance between fostering innovation and safeguarding public health.<br><br>
        
        As I stand on the cusp of graduating, my journey in regulatory affairs has been nothing short of transformative. From the bustling labs of UCR to the corridors of the FDA, I have seen firsthand the profound impact of effective regulation. With a solid foundation in biochemistry and a keen understanding of regulatory frameworks, I am excited to champion the cause of bridging science and society, ensuring that innovations are not just groundbreaking but also beneficial and safe for all.
